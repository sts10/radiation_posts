<h2>Favorite Tilde Sites and Things So Far</h2>
<p>OK so it's one thing to work on code in isolation, but the whole point of totally nuclear club and tilde club is to find others stretching their wings in this new-or-wait-actually-old but definitely unique space. People who I probably don't follow on other social networks and almost most certainly don't know in real life.</p>

<p>Of course what's interesting about these "clubs" or servers is that it is (purposefully) difficult both to discover and to regularly check them. By difficult I don't meant that there are passwords or errors-- I mean that there isn't a "follow" system or RSS feeds or even permalinks in some cases.</p>

<p>Rather delightfully, this leads people to publish (and hopefully keep up-to-date) very simple but also very useful standalone pages, like this list of <a href="http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/othertildes.html">Other Tildes</a>. Or this page dedicated to <a href="http://tilde.club/~joeld/tildelore.html">"Tilde Club Lore"</a>. And even my linking to them here makes this page and thus my blog a repository of information both for others to discover, and a place where those discoverers can come back to to find these links. Otherwise they can go "dark" or just vanish all together.</p>

<p>Note that the only way I've been keeping track of the growing tilde-verse is with a simple bookmarks folder in the bookmark bar of my Google Chrome that's simply called "tilde club stuff." Below are some of my favorite pages I've bookmarked so far.</p>

<p>So far my favorite actual site is <a href="http://tilde.club/~droob/">~droob</a> of Tilde Club. I'm not sure of Droob's real name or gender, but he or she is currently using their tilde site to blog about what I'd summarize as communications concepts and how they play out on the internet. Like how tools and analytics can be a <a href="http://tilde.club/~droob/index.html#bummer-machine">real bummer</a>, <a href="http://tilde.club/~droob/index.html#alcoves">insights from architecture</a>, an interesting list of <a href="http://tilde.club/~droob/index.html#negative-space">degrees of publishing</a>, and a <a href="http://tilde.club/~droob/#books">reading list</a>. Seems like a pretty smart person. </p>

<p>As for other sites I've bookmarked, there's 
<ul>
    <li>Tidle Club's creator <a href="http://tilde.club/~ford/">~ford</a></li>
    <li>totally nuclear creator <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~erik/">~erik</a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~crm/">~crm</a> (whose minimalistic Ruby CMS is super cool)</li>
    <li>My co-worker <a href="http://www.tilde.club/~summeranne/">~summeranne</a>, who has a nice recent post about work (that I merrily cannot link directly to)</li>
    <li><a href="http://tilde.club/~choire/">~choire</a> is as  silly as you'd think.</li>
    <li>One I just found tonight is tilde club's <a href="http://tilde.club/~_/index.html">~_</a>, who seems to be pretty prolific, and has a nice, annotated blog roll of other tildes on the left side of his blog (more tildes to discover!)</li>
</ul>
There are some others but they haven't been updated in some time.</p>
<p>I think that's where I'll leave you for now. I obviously don't have comments on this blog (yet?), so if you have something to say about this (like how YOU handle tilde discovery and regular checking) you can email me at ~schlink (from your totally nuclear email only, apparently). Heartsies.</p>
