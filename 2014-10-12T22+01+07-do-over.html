<h2>Do Over</h2>
<p>I stumbled on Paul Ford's <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">Medium post</a> about this <i>thing</i> he made called Tilde Club sometime last week. On Thursday night I got a minute to sit down and read it all the way through and I realized this might be something <strong>important</strong>.

I see now that it doesn't have to be confined to some sort of nostalgia trip for a bunch of 40-year-old blogging pioneers (although it might be just that for some folks). It might be an opportunity to get a do over with the Internet, but go back armed with the knowledge of what has worked and what hasn't over the relatively short history of the Internet.

    We're two paragraphs in now so, by convention, it's time for me to discuss my first encounters with the Internet. I was born in 1987, so my first surfride on the 'net was on an AOL account, via a dial-up modem. I mostly read Cartoon Network message boards I think. One funny memory was visiting www.whitehouse.com for a research project and finding a ton of porn (this was apparently during the Monica Lewinsky scandal). </p>
<p>
Later we used AIM. Our tiny buddy profiles were our homepages. I was in high school when Facebook blew up (I was a member of the few classes who had to wait for a college .edu email address to register). Facebook was the first "social network" I was involved in. Then Twitter came along midway through college, and was significantly bolstered by my getting my first iPhone senior year. Oh and Tumblr was big sneior year-- we had a fun group one called <a href="http://hashtaghashtag.tumblr.com">The ##</a> that we adored.
</p>
<p>
Out of school I eventually figured out that I could get paid to do this, so I've been involved with social media professionally ever since (currently I'm an Associate Social Media Editor at BuzzFeed News).

    Anyway, I joined totallynuclear.club today because I want to try to re-build the Internet better, from the command line. Today I built <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">a basic, crude CMS</a>. And I've already gotten offers from totallynuclear people-- strangers I have never met of course-- to help with it. Who knows what we'll have made by next weekend. When a friend asked if there was anyway to keep up with this tilde club posts, like via RSS or something, I said no, because no one's built that yet.
