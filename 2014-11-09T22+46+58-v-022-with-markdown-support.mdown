## Radiation, Now With Markdown Support

Super excited to show off [v 0.2.2](https://github.com/sts10/radiation), which allows users to compose posts in Markdown. 

To do this I used the [kramdown library](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/), which I learned about from [~crm's](http://totallynuclear.club/~crm/) simple CMS. Basically kramdown takes Markdown and converts it into HTML. I choose to use GitHub flavored markdown by default. I also had to add 4 `gsub`s on one line to handle smart quotes. But it seems to work now! 

Posts created in HTML will still be rendered in HTML and work just fine. And users who wish to contine to write posts in HTML may do so-- v 0.2.2 asks users when creating a new post whether they want to write in HTML or Markdown. So no worries!

Let me know if you see anything weird though!
