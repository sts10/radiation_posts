<h2>Hello World, From Radiation v 0.0.2!</h2>

<p>Hello world! This is Sam's totallynuclear blog!</p>

<p>I should probably write down how I logged in! First I think I entered `ssh schlink@totallynuclear.club` into my Terminal. Then I entered my password (which I've since changed to something super secret). That might have been it?</p>

<p>I spent the afternoon working on a very simple CMS for totallynuclear blogs. At some point I decided on the name Radiation, as it stays with the nuclear theme of totallynuclear. <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">Here's the public GitHub Repo</a>. It seems to be working well so far (I'm using it right now!).

The README has decent installation instructions, but let me know if you have any trouble. I wrote it in Ruby and ERB, so if that's your jam please let me know if you have any suggestion (I'm <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sts10">@sts10</a> on Twitter). </p>
