<h2>Radiation v 0.2.0</h2>
<p>
So thanks to an <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation/issues/3">issue submitted by ~erik about time-zone support</a> I banged out and pushed a pretty solid update to Radiation this afternoon. <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">v 0.2.0</a> has some basic time-zone support and features a new menu option called "edit user settings" which lets users easily edit 4 settings: timezone, blog location, text editor, and blog template location. This file is located at <code>/radiation/user_settings.rb</code>. </p>
<p>
So for a user to edit his or her time away from the default of 'America/New_York', the user would install v 0.2.0 of Radiation for time-zone support, then run the main menu. The user would then select 's - edit user settings' and change the first variable. I have been looking for a list of timezone options in this 'America/New_York' 'America/Los_Angeles' format, but all I've found so far that looks like this is this <a href="http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/zoneinfo">silly time-zone converter form</a>. If you find a more official-looking list please let me know. </p>
<p>
I'm glad I extracted a few of the basic user variables. Now, folks who aren't comfortable using vim can switch to nano pretty easily. Also if I get more bold in future versions I could remove the <code>user_settings.rb</code> file from the radiation directory, so that when users upgrade to a newer version of Radiation, their user settings would carry over seemlessly, just like their radiation_posts and radiation_templates do now. </p>
