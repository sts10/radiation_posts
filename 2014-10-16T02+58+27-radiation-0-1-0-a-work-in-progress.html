<h2>Radiation 0.1.1: A Work in Progress</h2>
<p>Tonight I tried to make a considerably large leap forward with <A href="http://github.com/sts10/radiation">Radiation</a>. The big thing I was attempting was to try to simplify the installation process by using the bash `ln` command, rather than forcing users to paste a multi-line function into their .bash_profile. I gave it a pretty good shot, and at one point I was so confident I merged my branch with master and pushed it up (sorry if anyone pulled down the doomed version 0.1.1 that was up for a bit a few hours ago). But I ran into problems with relative vs. absolute paths. I thought if I made the assumption that everyone install the radiation directory in the `~` directory, I could just hard-code everything with that, but I just couldn't get it working right. </p>
<p>I may give it another shot tomorrow. But at this point v 0.0.7 is a pretty solid build, and I think people can really save time and do more using it than not. It's also a decent code base for expanding upon. I hope it's clear to developers approaching it for the first time. </p>
<p>If you do want to see what I  was going for in v 0.1.1, you can see <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation/tree/0_1_1">that branch up on the repo</a>. I need to take a day or two break from it for now though.</p>
<p>Today's big lesson was that when you're sharing a program with a community who may rely on it for daily use, you have to be really careful that the default braanch (in this case I've kept it as master) is a working build at all times. Or at least you feel shitty when that branch is broken even for a few minutes-- imagining that one or two new users could be eagerly cloning your repo and following your broken installation instructions right at that moment. Thankfully Git is awesome and I was moderately quick in reverting back to a good commit of v 0.0.7. Maybe I'll have better luck later this week.</p>
