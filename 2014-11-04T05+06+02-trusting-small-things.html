<h2>Small, Trustworthy Things</h2>

<p>
I turned 27 this past weekend. Going from 26 to 27 feels like crossing a notable threshold-- a line between the optimistic plateau "mid-twenties" and something sloping toward 30. So far my twenties have been full of starts and stops, haphazardly accepting new responsibilities later than I probably should (paying for my own health insurance, fuck yeah!), and change the only constant. 
</p><p>
Last spring was the first time I had ever renewed a lease past a year. If you don't count high school or a college dorm, this is the first time I've lived in the same place for more than 12 months. With all this change and moving from one tiny city apartment to another, I've learned to find comfort in small things that I'll be able to keep for a few years. My world has been full of new challenges, and sometimes it's nice to be able to rely on a few personal objects to be consistent. 
</p><p>
I've written about things I've purchased before, once about <a href="https://medium.com/@sts10/10-things-ive-purchased-thanks-to-the-wirecutter-f66719075967">10 things I had bought</a> thanks to recommendations from a website called <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/">The Wirecutter</a>, and another about <a href="https://medium.com/adventures-in-consumer-technology/my-latest-obsession-mechanical-keyboards-ef9e28089327">a mechanical keyboard I researched and ordered</a> (more on that later). In general I dislike spending money, so I try to spend it wisely, doing an abundance of research on a particular item before actually pulling the trigger (that mechanical keyboard post is evidence of this I think).

Having now managed a few periods of earning a disposable income here and there, I've collected a few of these trustworthy items. I have more hopes that the non-electronic ones will last a longer time, but since so much of my life revolves around using technology, it's important to find good electronics too. A quick list: a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1380155114&sr=1-1&keywords=audio+technica+ath-m50">Audio Technica M-50 headphones</a>, a simple wool sweater, an Olympus OM-D EM-5 digital camera, a pair of cordovan boots, that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Filson-Large-Briefcase-Computer-Desert/dp/B007NVMP0M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1380157004&sr=8-1&keywords=filson+briefcase">Filson bag</a>, this <a href="http://collectedworksco.com/items/waxed-canvas-military-duffle-backpack/">military duffle</a> all qualify.

My most recent purchase of this type was a $380 computer keyboard called a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/PFU-Hacking-Keyboard-Professional2-English/dp/B008GXQWOG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415067073&sr=8-1&keywords=happy+hacking+type+s">Happy Hacking Professional-2 Type-S</a> (or HHKB 2 for short). Yes, $380 is an almost comical amount of money to spend on an accessory that comes with my $1,200 MacBook Air. But I hope it will last me many years, so that no matter what computer I plug it in to, the feeling and layout will be exactly the same, and thus familiar. (As proof of the keyboard's durability, here is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/2kp01c/yep_that_hhkb_spacebar_is_abs/">a Reddit photo post of the HHKB Pro1</a> that's probably <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/2kp01c/yep_that_hhkb_spacebar_is_abs/clnnrze">10 to 18 years old</a> and looks great except for a slight, worn-in dent in the space-bar.)

I'm pretty certain I can type faster, more accurately, and with less fatigue than on the standard Apple keyboard or even the first mechanical keyboard I got, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ES-87-Tenkeyless-Mechanical-Keyboard-Cherry/dp/B00KI1ZAHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415073735&sr=8-1&keywords=kul+es-87">KUL ES-87</a> thanks to a number of reasons. But it's also just more fun to type on. And that's what I go for with these products-- I want tools to go headfirst in to the great unknown with, to minimize variables and ensure familiarity when I can, and that can sometimes make me just a bit more excited to do things with them. To give me reason to take them out and do work with them. To give me a reason to cheer up when I've been setback by some new, seemingly-daunting challenge.

I've quoted this Rilke verse before, but it kind of fits right here at the end of this post, and I like the idea of sharing it whenever I can. It's from one of his poems called "The Man Watching." One translation is: 
</p>

<blockquote>What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.</blockquote> 

<p>
Believing this, I've taken time to choose my small things (and <a href="http://schlinkblog.tumblr.com/post/96430718235/i-never-chose-what-i-wanted-to-do-in-life-because">small decisions</a>) slowly and wisely, so that I can trust them when I go into the fight, win or lose.
