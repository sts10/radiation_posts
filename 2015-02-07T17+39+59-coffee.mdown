## My First Few Weeks Drinking Coffee

Before these past holidays I had never had more than a sip of coffee. That usually surprises people, but through high school I was a pretty natural early riser, and in college I managed to take late-starting philosophy classes. 

However, my new job has me up and working at 6 a.m., and assuming my body is done growing, it seemed as good a time as any for me to give it a try. 

Luckily my brother, who is very much into coffee, got me an Aeropress and an expensive grinder for Christmas. I soon got an electric kettle and a thermos to drink out of and tried it out one Sunday in early January as a practice run.
