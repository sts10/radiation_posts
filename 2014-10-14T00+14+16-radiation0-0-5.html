<h2>Radiation v 0.0.5</h2>
<p>
    Just pushed <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">Radiation v 0.0.5</a> up to GitHub. Knocked 3 big things off my to do list tonight: (1) Drastically simplified the number and semantics of the Ruby models, (2) fixed a creation time bug, and (3) took the blog template ERB file out of the radiation directory, much as I did with the posts directory yesterday. Due to these changes I also changed the installation process a bit. I hope it is easier for both new and upgrading users.

    I think 0.0.5 is an OK product. No permalinks or drafts or anything fancy, and I'm definitely still not satisfied with the installation process, but it's on its way. Oh, a decent goal for tomorrow or Wednesday would be a nifty little menu for editing previously published posts. There's always  more to do.

    I did take a minute to browse some other totallynuclear sites this afternoon (that's what this is about, right!) and I found the <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~crm/">~crm</a> totally wrote his or her own (much simpler) CMS using Ruby and ERB. In fact, it's only one file! Kudos! I haven't pasted it into an editor and tried it yet, but it certainly looks like it gets the job done.</p>

    OK well that's about it for now. Let's hope this post publishes as intended!
