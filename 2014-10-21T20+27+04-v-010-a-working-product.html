<h2>Radiation v 0.1.0: A Working Product</h2>
<p>
It may not be the prettiest code I've ever written, and the installation process may still be unsatisfactory and clunky, but <a href="https://github.com/sts10/radiation">Radiation v 0.1.0</a> works. (Unlike the complex and doomed version 0.1.1 which I will skip over and we will never discuss again).</p>
<p>In fact, Totally Nuclear host <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~erik/">~erik</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/erikprice/status/524183448513437697">using it</a> on his homepage! I'm so flattered. </p>

<p>
Since it seems to be pretty stable and customizable, I think I'm going to let it chill at v 0.1.0 for a while (pending any bug fixes or improvements that I work out or get submitted to me via a pull request or Github issue). 
The one feature I might tinker with adding would be to allow users to write posts in Markdown (and use a Ruby gem to convert it to HTML, but I've never done that and am not sure how difficult it will be). Hopefully more tilde people will use this current version and have the pleasure of writing out old-school HTML in the terminal though! 
</p>
<p>This also frees up the time I spent working on it and blogging about it here to explore totally nuclear and other tilde clubs that I've found so far, plus find new ones. Cuz that's what these things are all about, right? Old school Internet communities? Excited to see what I find and can report back to you here.</p>
